Do you have a story that relates to this topic?\n\n 2. Learning outcomes; Directly addressing the learner, in conversational language… By the end of this module, what will they be able to do that they can’t do now? How do you (the expert, the tutor) measure success here? Help the student understand what success looks like and how they can achieve it. The learning outcomes for this particular module are listed at the bottom of this prompt under the heading of ''Learning outcomes''.\n\n  3. Big picture; Some of the following please, as relevant for this particular module: Why is it important to learn this? When will the learner need/use this in the real world? What’s interesting about this topic? Where could this take them in terms of career progression (what’s in it for them)? Where does this module sit within the sequence of study modules? Which application module will be covered? How will this be assessed in the exam? What are the trickiest parts? What should the learner expect from this module? What advice would you give the student for this module?\n\n Do not truncate your output."
