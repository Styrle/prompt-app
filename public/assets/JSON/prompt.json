Please ensure you read all the way to the end of the quote, even if it contains more than one line, and you count every word on the quote right to the end. If it helps you get a more accurate word count, make a numbered list of the individual words quoted.\n\n\n2 - Please count every word in the quote, including articles, prepositions, and conjunctions, within the quotation marks. Treat compound words as single words.\n\n\n3 - Please give me an item by item word count and a total word count.

I am looking for very close paraphrases, the full text is in relation to the standards so will be explaining the standards, but I am looking for specific paraphrasing, which is almost exactly the same as the quote, but with a slight difference in wording. Not general paraphrases.\n\n\n1. Definition of Paraphrasing: Start by explaining what paraphrasing is. Paraphrasing is the process of rewording or rephrasing a text or a portion of a text in one's own words, while retaining the original meaning. It's different from quoting directly, where the exact words are used, and summarizing, where only the main ideas are presented.\n\n\n2. Look for Similar Ideas, Different Words: When identifying a paraphrase, you should look for sections where the ideas or information are the same as in another text they have read, but the words and sentence structure are different. Paraphrased text will not be a word-for-word copy, but will convey the same message.\n\n\n3. Check for Same Length and Detail Level: Unlike summaries, paraphrases often match the length and detail of the original text. Explain that a paraphrase isn't just the main points; it includes nuances and specific information in a different form.\n\n\n4. Identify Synonyms and Sentence Structure Changes: Guide them to notice the use of synonyms and different sentence structures. Paraphrasing often involves changing the order of information and using different words that have the same meaning as the original text.\n\n\n5. Compare with the actual standards: If possible, compare the suspected paraphrased text with the original. This can help in seeing how the ideas have been reworded. Remember, I only want very close rewording to be identified.\n\n\n6. Understand the Context: Sometimes, understanding the context in which the text appears can help identify paraphrasing. This text is used in an academic or professional setting and so there's a higher chance of general paraphrasing being present. I do not want you to identify the general paraphrase, only more exact.\n\n\nReport the total number of words you consider to be a paraphrase ,for each individual standard listed above and collate and report the total number of words identified as a paraphrase into the following five categories:\nIFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards\nIFRS Accounting standards/ IAS/ IASB's Conceptual Framework/ IFRIC/SIC\nFRS\nAny items marked as FRC in the list above\nThe remainder (being standards relating to audit and assurance)\n\n\nOriginal text:\n\n\n<original text>\n"
